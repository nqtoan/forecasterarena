## Full Description (for GitHub)
```
Forecaster Arena is an academic-grade benchmark that tests Large Language Model (LLM) forecasting capabilities using real prediction markets from Polymarket. Unlike traditional benchmarks contaminated by training data, this uses reality as the ultimate test - markets resolve based on real-world outcomes that no model could have memorized.

Seven frontier LLMs compete in weekly cohorts, making probabilistic forecasts on real prediction markets. Models are evaluated on both calibration (Brier Score) and practical value (Portfolio P/L). All prompts, decisions, and outcomes are fully transparent for reproducibility.

Features:
- Real prediction markets from Polymarket
- 7 competing LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 4, DeepSeek V3.1, Kimi K2, Qwen 3 Next)
- Weekly cohorts with $10,000 starting balance
- Brier Score + Portfolio P/L evaluation
- Full transparency: all prompts and decisions logged
- Open source and reproducible

Tech Stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, SQLite, OpenRouter API
